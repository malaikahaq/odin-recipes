    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This is a quick and easy way to make this soup that is usually served at
      Chinese restaurants. For a tangy/hot flavor try this: about 3 to 4 hours
      before serving combine 1/4 cup vinegar and 3 finely chopped green chilies.
      Refrigerate until serving time and then sprinkle about a teaspoon of this
      on the soup. Enjoy!! Garnish with fresh scallions.

        In a medium stock pot combine broth, corn and chicken. Bring to a boil,
        reduce heat and add pepper and salt. Bring back to a boil.

        In a separate bowl mix the corn starch with water. While the soup is
        boiling add this mixture, and stir constantly until well mixed.

      <li>
        Season with sesame oil by adding a few drops at a time. Reduce heat, and
        slowly add egg white while swirling the soup with a fork in order to
        break egg pieces apart.
